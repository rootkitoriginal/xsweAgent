## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.analytics.engine import create_analytics_engine

# Create engine (includes retry, metrics, logging)
engine = await create_analytics_engine()

# Run analysis (automatic retry, metrics tracking)
results = await engine.analyze(issues, "owner/repo")

# Access results
for analysis_type, result in results.items():
    print(f"{analysis_type}: {result.summary}")
```

### With Metrics Monitoring

```python
from src.utils import get_metrics_collector

collector = get_metrics_collector()

# Run analysis
results = await engine.analyze(issues, "owner/repo")

# Check metrics
success_count = collector.get_counter("analytics_engine_calls_total", status="success")
avg_duration = collector.get_timer_stats("analytics_engine_call_duration")["avg_ms"]
```

### With Health Checks

```python
from src.utils import register_health_check, get_health_registry

# Register health check
register_health_check("analytics", check_analytics_available)

# Check health
registry = get_health_registry()
results = await registry.check_all()
overall_status = await registry.get_overall_status()
```

## 🎨 Design Patterns Used

1. **Strategy Pattern**: Different analysis strategies
2. **Decorator Pattern**: Retry, circuit breaker, metrics decorators
3. **Registry Pattern**: Health check and circuit breaker registries
4. **Factory Pattern**: Analytics engine factory function
5. **Singleton Pattern**: Global metrics collector, health registry

## 🔒 Error Handling & Resilience

### Layers of Protection

1. **Retry Layer**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
2. **Circuit Breaker Layer**: Fail fast when service is down
3. **Metrics Layer**: Track all operations for monitoring
4. **Logging Layer**: Structured logs with correlation IDs
5. **Health Check Layer**: Monitor system health

### Failure Scenarios Handled

- ✅ Transient failures (retry mechanism)
- ✅ Service unavailability (circuit breaker)
- ✅ Insufficient data (validation)
- ✅ Individual strategy failures (graceful degradation)
- ✅ Timeout scenarios (health check timeouts)

## 📈 Performance Characteristics

### Analytics Engine
- **Concurrent Execution**: Strategies run in parallel via `asyncio.gather()`
- **Caching**: 30-minute TTL by default (configurable)
- **Time Windows**: Configurable to limit data processing
- **Retry Overhead**: 5 seconds per retry attempt (configurable)

### Infrastructure
